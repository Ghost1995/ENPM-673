# Problem 3

**Problem Statement**

*Given:* A stationary frame A is rotated about axis ZA by 30 degrees and then rotated about axis XA by 45 degrees; A frame B, which originally is coincident with frame A, is first rotated about ZB by 30 degrees, and then rotated about the new XB by 45 degrees.

*To Code:* A MATLAB function to give the rotation matrix that accomplishes these two rotations.

**Running the Code**

Simply run *problem_3.m* in the code folder.

**Result**

The result are the two rotation matrices.

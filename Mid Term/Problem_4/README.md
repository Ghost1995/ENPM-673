# Problem 4

**Problem Statement**

*Given:* A stereo pair of two scan-line aligned images.

*To Code:* A MATLAB function to compute the disparity map of the stereo pair.

**Running the Code**

Simply run *problem_4.m* in the code folder.

**Result**

The result are the disparity maps produced using various methods, namely Sum of Squared Differences (SSD), Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD), Sub-pixel Refinement, Median Filtering, Energy Minimization, and Adpative Windowing.
For energy minimization and adaptive windowing, only one iteration has been done.
